It's been over six months since I've posted anything, but thankfully this is mostly a symptom of how productive those months have been.&lt;/p&gt;

I have heard over and over again how contributing is important to becoming a better software engineer. Whilst also reading numerous rants by those who are resentful that open source contributions have become a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">keyan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2015 11:43:19 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2015-02-12:/open-sorcery.html</guid></item><item><title>"A Reflection"</title><link>/a-reflection.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It's crazy to think it has already been five weeks, but soon enough I will hit the half-way point of my official time at RC. I say official  because, you know, never graduate. The last couple weeks were difficult for me but I'm glad I can say I've learned a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">keyan</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2015 17:43:19 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2015-02-06:/a-reflection.html</guid></item><item><title>"The man of simple faith who loves learning for his burden is love"</title><link>/the-man-of-simple-faith-who-loves-learning-for-his-burden-is-love.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;That title was generated by my Markov chain text generator that I just finished working on. Even though it's stochastically generated text, I feel like it is speaking to me. That might sound strange, that's because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a side project I did after a fellow Recurser and …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">keyan</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2015 23:30:12 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2015-01-23:/the-man-of-simple-faith-who-loves-learning-for-his-burden-is-love.html</guid></item><item><title>"Hello World!"</title><link>/hello-world.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I finally started a blog! I've heard that keeping a blog is an easy way to practice writing and can be educational, so why have I been putting this off?&lt;/p&gt;
