    <p>So it's safe to safe I've failed at keeping a relatively up to date informative blog. It's been over six months since I've posted anything, but thankfully this is mostly a symptom of how productive those months have been.</p>
<p>So what happened since I posted last? Well I worked a little more on my Flask tool, <a href="https://github.com/pocoo/flask-ext-migrate">flask-ext-migrate</a>, which was eventually separated into it's own repository. I also worked on a few personal projects including a barebones Dropbox clone I affectionately coined <a href="https://github.com/keyan/flopbox">flopbox</a>, a collaborative drawing game <a href="https://github.com/keyan/scrawl">scrawl</a> (which is actually hosted on this domain: scrawl.keyanp.com), and a completely non-functional abandoned chess AI, <a href="https://github.com/keyan/swordfish">swordfish</a>, that I worked on with my friend <a href="https://github.com/jpoler">Jon Poler</a>.</p>
<p>During this time I was also accepted to the MSCS program at <a href="www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a>, which I had applied to before deciding to go to Recurse Center. After many discussions with peers and mentors I decided to enroll and started looking for a summer internship. Many phone calls and countless questions about sorting algorithms later I landed a great position at <a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a> as a backend platform engineer. I ended up enjoying my time there so much that I am ultimately putting off going back to school so I can focus on becoming a better programmer and engineer. I'm just having too much fun programming full-time to give it up quite yet.</p>
