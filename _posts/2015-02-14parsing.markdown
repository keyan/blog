Previously I wrote a little about working on [Flask][1] and how open source contributing has been rewarding for me, but I wanted to dive deeper and talk about the issue I was working on a couple weeks ago.

For those of you who have used Flask before or maybe even developed your own Flask exten

lib2to3 parses code into a parse tree, unlike `parser` or `ast` it pays attention to comments and formating

[RedBaron][2] --> FST instead of AST, so it preserves formating
Jamie Zawinski:

"Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems."
"from flask.ext.foo import bar" becomes:

    FromImportNode()
        values ->
            NameNode()
                value='flask'
            NameNode()
                value='ext'
            NameNode()
                value='foo'
        targets ->
            NameAsNameNode()
                value='bar'
                target=''
