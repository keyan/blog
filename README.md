My personal webpage and blog. Mostly aspirational.

## Notes

So I don't forget how to get this up and running again.

1. Install requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`
2. Write content in `./content`
3. Generate output files: `pelican content/`
4. Check out the changes locally: `make serve`
5. Upload to S3: `make s3_upload`
