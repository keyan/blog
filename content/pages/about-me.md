title: about me

Hi, I am Keyan, a software engineer currently living in Brooklyn NY and working at [Teachers Pay Teachers][tpt]. Previously I worked on the Platform team at [Venmo][venmo] and never-graduated from the [Recurse Center][rc]. Before playing with computers I played with [bacteria][molmicro]. Thankfully it's much easier to tell computers what to do.

Aside from programming I like rock climbing, watching movies, biking, and thinking about warmer weather.

### contact me

Find me on [Github][github] / [Twitter][Twitter] or get in touch with me at <kpishdadian@gmail.com> whether you want to discuss the meaning of life or just say `Hello`.
