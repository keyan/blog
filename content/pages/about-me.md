title: about me

Hi, I am Keyan, a software engineer currently living in Seattle WA. At the moment I'm on something of a sabbatical so that I can learn more about robotics and AI, but previously I've worked at a handful of software companies in Seattle and NYC. Years ago I spent a few wonderful months at the [Recurse Center][rc] but ultimately I never graduated. Before playing with computers I played with [bacteria][molmicro]. Thankfully it's much easier to tell computers what to do.

I like thinking about economics, transportation, healthcare, and the future of work. For fun I like to [climb rocks][rocks], lift heavy things, watch movies, bike, swim, and cook.

### contact me

Find me on [Github][github] or get in touch with me at <kpishdadian@gmail.com> whether you want to discuss the meaning of life or just say `Hello`.
