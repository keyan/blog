title: about me

Hi, I am Keyan, a software engineer currently living in Seattle WA and working on the [public transit][transit] team at [Lyft][lyft]. Previously I worked on infrastructure at [Teachers Pay Teachers][tpt], scaled the platform at [Venmo][venmo], and never-graduated from the [Recurse Center][rc]. Before playing with computers I played with [bacteria][molmicro]. Thankfully it's much easier to tell computers what to do.

Aside from programming I like rock climbing, watching movies, biking, swimming, and cooking.

### contact me

Find me on [Github][github] or get in touch with me at <kpishdadian@gmail.com> whether you want to discuss the meaning of life or just say `Hello`.
