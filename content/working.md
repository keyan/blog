title:  "Working"

So it's safe to safe I've failed at keeping a relatively up to date informative blog. It's been over six months since I've posted anything, but thankfully this is mostly a symptom of how productive those months have been.

So what happened since I posted last? Well I worked a little more on my Flask tool, [flask-ext-migrate][1], which was eventually separated into it's own repository. I also worked on a few personal projects including a barebones Dropbox clone I affectionately coined [flopbox][2], a collaborative drawing game [scrawl][3] (which is actually hosted on this domain: scrawl.keyanp.com), and a completely non-functional abandoned chess AI, [swordfish][4], that I worked on with my friend [Jon Poler][5].

During this time I was also accepted to the MSCS program at [Dartmouth College][6], which I had applied to before deciding to go to Recurse Center. After many discussions with peers and mentors I decided to enroll and started looking for a summer internship. Many phone calls and countless questions about sorting algorithms later I landed a great position at [Venmo][7] as a backend platform engineer. I ended up enjoying my time there so much that I am ultimately putting off going back to school so I can focus on becoming a better programmer and engineer. I'm just having too much fun programming full-time to give it up quite yet.
