Hi, I am Keyan Pishdadian, a programmer currently living in Brooklyn NY where 
I am working on fun open source projects at [Hacker School][hs]. Before I 
started playing with computers I played with [bacteria][molmicro]. Thankfully 
it's much easier to tell computers what to do.

Aside from programming I like rock climbing, watching movies, biking, and 
thinking about warmer weather.

### Contact me

Find me on [Github][github] / [Twitter][Twitter] or get in touch with me at 
<kpishdadian@gmail.com> whether you want to discuss the 
meaning of life or just say `Hello`.
